# WunderGraph Demo

This repository demonstrates how to use WunderGraph in different scenarios.

## Prerequisites

For all the demos, you need wunderctl, the cli to manage WunderGraph applications.
With wunderctl you can "init" new WunderGraph projects and start "up" a local dev environment.

Install it

```shell
npm install -g @wundergraph/wunderctl
or
yarn global add @wundergraph/wunderctl
```
